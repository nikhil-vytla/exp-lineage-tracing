# Exploring Strategies for Lineage Tracing using scRNA-seq data

This repo contains exploratory notebooks and other resources related to the following topics:
- Pseudotime
  - Description: Use single-cell gene expression profiles to construct a trajectory that represents progression of a biological process over “time.”
  - Example methods: TSCAN (R), Slingshot (R), Monocle 2/3 (R), destiny (R)
- RNA Velocity
  - Description: Compares unspliced:spliced transcript ratio for each gene to infer future state of each cell.
  - Example methods: velociraptor (R), scVelo (Python), velocyto (R/Python)
- Additional Resources
  - Seurat PBMC tutorial
  - Supplemental notebooks for Monocle

Work was performed as a Bioinformatics Intern at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Ceenter for Cancer Genomics (DFCI CCG) during Summer 2024.
